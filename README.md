# Ames House Price Prediction (Rstudio)

In this project, the goal is to develop a parsimonious linear predictive model for house prices in Ames, Iowa, using a dataset split into training and test sets (with 1,460 and 1,459 observations, respectively). The model achieved R^2 of 0.872 on Validation Set and a log RMSE of 0.16217 on Test data.

The target variable, SalePrice, is provided in the training set but omitted from the test set.

In this notebook, I will conduct data cleaning, data manipulation, model development and cross-validation.
